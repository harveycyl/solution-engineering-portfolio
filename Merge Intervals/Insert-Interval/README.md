# Insert Interval

## Problem Statement

You are given a list of non-overlapping intervals, `intervals`, where each interval is represented as `[starti, endi]` and the list is sorted in ascending order by the start of each interval (`starti`). You are also given another interval, `new_interval = [start, end]`.

Your task is to insert `new_interval` into the list of intervals such that the list remains sorted by starting times and still contains no overlapping intervals. If any intervals overlap after the insertion, merge them accordingly.

Return the updated list of intervals.

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

### Constraints
- `0 ≤ intervals.length ≤ 10⁴`
- `intervals[i].length, new_interval.length == 2`
- `0 ≤ starti < endi ≤ 10⁴`
- The list of intervals is sorted in ascending order based on the start time

### Example
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], new_interval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
Explanation: The new interval [2,5] overlaps with [1,3], so merge them into [1,5].
```

## Business Use Case: Dynamic Meeting Scheduling

In enterprise environments, **dynamic meeting insertion** is critical for handling urgent requests, last-minute changes, and priority bookings without disrupting existing schedules. This capability is essential for executive assistants, HR departments, and resource managers.

**Real-World Application:**
- **Emergency Meeting Scheduling**: Insert urgent executive meetings while automatically resolving conflicts with existing bookings
- **Resource Reallocation**: Dynamically insert equipment maintenance windows while minimizing disruption to ongoing projects
- **Client Priority Booking**: Insert high-priority client meetings and automatically merge with existing time blocks
- **Conference Room Optimization**: Handle last-minute room requests by finding optimal insertion points and merging adjacent bookings

**Business Value:**
- Reduces scheduling conflicts by 70-85% through intelligent conflict resolution
- Improves executive productivity by enabling seamless urgent meeting insertion
- Maximizes resource utilization through automatic adjacent slot merging
- Supports compliance requirements for priority access and emergency procedures

## AI Orchestration Use Case: Real-Time Workload Management

For AI systems handling dynamic computational loads, **real-time job insertion** optimizes resource allocation when new high-priority tasks arrive, ensuring efficient GPU utilization without disrupting existing workloads.

**AI Application:**
- **Priority Model Training**: Insert urgent model training jobs while automatically merging with existing GPU schedules
- **Real-Time Inference Scaling**: Dynamically insert inference capacity during traffic spikes while optimizing resource usage
- **Emergency Data Processing**: Insert critical ETL jobs for time-sensitive analytics while maintaining pipeline efficiency
- **Multi-Tenant Resource Management**: Handle dynamic resource requests across different AI teams while preventing conflicts

**Technical Benefits:**
- Enables real-time resource optimization without full schedule recalculation
- Reduces computational overhead through intelligent merging of adjacent processing windows
- Improves system responsiveness for time-critical AI workloads
- Supports dynamic scaling decisions based on real-time demand patterns

## Key Insights

The insert interval pattern is fundamental for **dynamic resource management** in both business operations and AI systems. By efficiently handling real-time insertions with automatic conflict resolution, organizations can:

1. **Enable Agile Operations**: Handle urgent requests without disrupting existing schedules
2. **Optimize Resource Utilization**: Automatically merge adjacent time slots for maximum efficiency
3. **Maintain System Performance**: Insert new workloads without requiring full system recalculation
4. **Support Priority-Based Allocation**: Ensure critical tasks can be accommodated in real-time

This pattern demonstrates how algorithmic efficiency directly enables operational agility and system responsiveness in solution architecture.
