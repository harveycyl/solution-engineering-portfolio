# Merge Intervals

## Problem Statement

We are given an array of closed intervals called `intervals`, where each interval has a start time and an end time and is represented as `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`. Your task is to merge the overlapping intervals and return a new output array consisting of only the non-overlapping intervals.

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

### Constraints
- `1 ≤ intervals.length ≤ 10³`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 ≤ starti ≤ endi ≤ 10⁴`

### Example
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
```

## Business Use Case: Calendar and Resource Scheduling

In enterprise environments, merging intervals is crucial for **optimizing meeting schedules and resource allocation**. When multiple teams book conference rooms, equipment, or shared resources, overlapping reservations create conflicts that need resolution.

**Real-World Application:**
- **Meeting Room Management**: Merge overlapping meeting requests to identify actual room usage patterns and optimize booking policies
- **Resource Allocation**: Consolidate equipment reservations to maximize utilization and identify availability gaps
- **Employee Scheduling**: Merge overlapping shift patterns to ensure adequate coverage and prevent double-booking
- **Project Timeline Management**: Consolidate overlapping project phases to identify critical path dependencies

**Business Value:**
- Reduces scheduling conflicts by 60-80%
- Improves resource utilization efficiency by identifying optimal booking patterns
- Enables proactive capacity planning through consolidated time slot analysis
- Supports compliance reporting for resource usage auditing

## AI Orchestration Use Case: Workload Optimization

For AI systems managing multiple concurrent tasks, merging time intervals helps **optimize computational resource allocation** and prevent processing conflicts across distributed workloads.

**AI Application:**
- **GPU Cluster Management**: Merge overlapping AI training job schedules to optimize GPU utilization and prevent resource contention
- **Model Inference Batching**: Consolidate overlapping inference request windows to maximize throughput and reduce latency
- **Data Pipeline Orchestration**: Merge overlapping ETL processing windows to prevent data corruption and optimize pipeline efficiency
- **Multi-Model Deployment**: Coordinate overlapping model serving schedules to balance computational load across infrastructure

**Technical Benefits:**
- Reduces computational overhead by eliminating redundant processing windows
- Improves system throughput through optimized resource scheduling
- Prevents memory conflicts in multi-tenant AI environments
- Enables predictive scaling based on consolidated workload patterns

## Key Insights

The merge intervals pattern is fundamental for **time-based resource optimization** in both business operations and AI systems. By consolidating overlapping time periods, organizations can:

1. **Maximize Resource Efficiency**: Eliminate scheduling conflicts and optimize utilization
2. **Improve System Performance**: Reduce computational overhead through intelligent batching
3. **Enable Better Planning**: Provide clear visibility into actual vs. requested resource usage
4. **Support Scalability**: Create foundation for predictive resource allocation algorithms

This pattern demonstrates how algorithmic thinking directly translates to operational excellence in solution architecture.
