# Find The Duplicate Number: Data Deduplication to Anomaly Detection

This solution demonstrates how Floyd's cycle detection can solve both enterprise data deduplication and AI anomaly detection challenges.

## 1. Traditional Business Scenario: Enterprise Data Deduplication

### Problem Statement
A data warehouse management system needs to:
- Identify duplicate records in large datasets without modifying original data
- Maintain data integrity during ETL processes with memory constraints
- Detect data quality issues in real-time streaming environments
- Ensure compliance with storage optimization and cost reduction requirements

### Business Impact
- Reduces storage costs by 30-40% through efficient duplicate detection
- Improves data quality and analytics accuracy
- Maintains GDPR compliance through proper data deduplication
- Enables real-time data processing without memory overhead
- Prevents data corruption during high-volume ingestion processes

### Example
```python
customer_ids = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]  # Customer database with duplicate
duplicate_id = find_duplicate_record(customer_ids)
# Result: 2 (duplicate customer record detected)
# Critical for maintaining data warehouse integrity
```

## 2. Modern AI Application: Anomaly Detection and Model Validation

### Problem Statement
An AI system monitoring platform needs to:
- Detect recurring anomalies in model prediction patterns
- Identify duplicate feature patterns that indicate model overfitting
- Monitor for repeated error patterns in AI system behavior
- Validate data pipelines for duplicate training samples affecting model performance

### Technical Innovation
The same algorithm that finds data duplicates can enhance AI monitoring:
- Real-time anomaly pattern detection in model outputs
- Overfitting identification through duplicate feature pattern analysis
- Model validation through training data integrity verification
- Automated detection of recurring system errors and performance issues

### Example
```python
prediction_patterns = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]  # AI model output pattern sequence
anomaly_pattern = detect_recurring_anomaly(prediction_patterns)
# Result: 2 (recurring anomaly pattern identified)
# Essential for maintaining AI system reliability and performance
```

## 3. Algorithm Overview

### Core Problem
Find the duplicate number in an array of n+1 integers in range [1,n]:
- Use Floyd's Cycle Detection algorithm treating array as linked list
- Map array values as pointers: nums[i] points to index nums[i]
- Detect cycle entrance which corresponds to the duplicate number
- Achieve constant space complexity without modifying input array

### Key Insights
- Transform array traversal into linked list cycle detection
- Fast and slow pointers to detect cycle existence
- Second phase to find cycle entrance (duplicate number)
- Constant space solution respecting immutability constraint

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of array
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) using only pointer variables
