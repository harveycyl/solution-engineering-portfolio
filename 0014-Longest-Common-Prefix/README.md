# Longest Common Prefix: API Versioning to AI Model Alignment

This solution demonstrates how finding common prefixes can solve both API versioning challenges and modern AI model alignment problems.

## 1. Traditional Business Scenario: API Versioning and URL Routing

### Problem Statement
A SaaS company managing multiple API endpoints needs to:
- Optimize URL routing by identifying common path prefixes
- Implement efficient API gateway configurations
- Reduce redundant routing rules and improve performance
- Standardize endpoint naming conventions across services

### Business Impact
- Reduces API gateway configuration complexity
- Improves routing performance through prefix optimization
- Standardizes microservice communication patterns
- Enables efficient load balancing and caching strategies
- Simplifies API documentation and client SDK generation

### Example
```python
api_endpoints = [
    "/api/v1/users/profile",
    "/api/v1/users/settings", 
    "/api/v1/users/preferences"
]
common_prefix = "/api/v1/users/"
# Enables optimized routing: single rule handles all user endpoints
```

## 2. Modern AI Application: Model Response Alignment

### Problem Statement
An AI orchestration system needs to:
- Identify common patterns in multiple AI model responses
- Align model outputs for consensus-based decision making
- Extract shared semantic content across different models
- Optimize prompt engineering through common response patterns

### Technical Innovation
The same algorithm that finds URL prefixes can align AI responses:
- Multiple models generate responses to the same prompt
- Find common starting patterns to identify consensus
- Use shared prefixes to validate model alignment
- Optimize multi-model reasoning chains

### Example
```python
ai_responses = [
    "The solution requires careful analysis of the data patterns",
    "The solution requires careful consideration of user needs",
    "The solution requires careful implementation planning"
]
common_insight = "The solution requires careful"
# Indicates strong model consensus on approach methodology
```

## 3. Algorithm Overview

### Core Problem
Find the longest string that is a common prefix of all strings in an array:
- Handle empty arrays and strings gracefully
- Process character-by-character comparison
- Stop at first mismatch or end of shortest string
- Return empty string if no common prefix exists

### Key Insights
- Compare characters vertically across all strings
- Use the shortest string as the upper bound
- Early termination on first mismatch
- Handle edge cases (empty input, single string)

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(S) where S is the sum of all characters in all strings
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the iterative approach, O(m) for recursive (m = length of shortest string)
