# Roman to Integer: Legacy System Integration to Modern Data Parsing

This solution demonstrates how Roman numeral conversion can solve both legacy system integration challenges and modern data transformation needs.

## 1. Traditional Business Scenario: Legacy System Integration

### Problem Statement
A financial institution is migrating from a legacy mainframe system that uses:
- Roman numerals for transaction sequencing (e.g., "MCMXCIV" for transaction 1994)
- Historical numbering schemes in archived records
- Complex conversion requirements for data migration
- Need for accurate parsing to maintain data integrity

### Business Impact
- Enables seamless legacy system migration
- Preserves historical data accuracy
- Reduces manual conversion errors
- Accelerates digital transformation initiatives
- Maintains regulatory compliance during migration

### Example
```python
legacy_transactions = ["III", "LVIII", "MCMXCIV"]
modern_ids = [3, 58, 1994]
# Critical for maintaining transaction history integrity
```

## 2. Modern AI Application: Multi-Format Data Parsing

### Problem Statement
An AI system needs to:
- Parse diverse numerical formats from global documents
- Handle historical documents with Roman numerals
- Normalize data for machine learning pipelines
- Process mixed-format datasets efficiently

### Technical Innovation
The same algorithm that converts Roman numerals can enhance AI data preprocessing:
- Multi-format numerical extraction from documents
- Historical document digitization
- Cross-cultural data normalization
- Enhanced OCR post-processing

### Example
```python
document_extracts = [
    {"format": "roman", "value": "MCMXCIV", "context": "historical_record"},
    {"format": "roman", "value": "LVIII", "context": "legal_document"},
    {"format": "roman", "value": "III", "context": "manuscript"}
]
# AI system converts all to standardized integer format: [1994, 58, 3]
```

## 3. Algorithm Overview

### Core Problem
Convert Roman numerals to integers efficiently, handling:
- Basic symbols: I(1), V(5), X(10), L(50), C(100), D(500), M(1000)
- Subtraction cases: IV(4), IX(9), XL(40), XC(90), CD(400), CM(900)
- Left-to-right processing with context awareness

### Key Insights
- Process from left to right
- Compare current and next characters
- Subtract when smaller precedes larger (IV, IX, etc.)
- Add when normal ordering applies

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the Roman numeral
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) using constant space for the mapping
