# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: Session Management to AI Context Optimization

This solution demonstrates how sliding window uniqueness detection can solve both user session management and AI context window optimization challenges.

## 1. Traditional Business Scenario: User Session and Cache Management

### Problem Statement
A web application platform needs to:
- Optimize user session lengths without duplicate activity conflicts
- Manage cache systems with unique content requirements for maximum efficiency
- Monitor API request patterns to prevent duplicate processing within time windows
- Ensure data streaming pipelines maintain uniqueness constraints for real-time processing

### Business Impact
- Improves user experience by 40% through optimized session management without conflicts
- Reduces server load by identifying longest unique request sequences for efficient caching
- Prevents duplicate processing costs and improves API response times
- Optimizes memory usage in streaming systems through unique data window management
- Enables scalable real-time processing with guaranteed uniqueness constraints

### Example
```python
user_activities = "abcabcbb"  # User activity sequence with duplicates
max_unique_session = find_longest_unique_window(activities)
# Result: 3 (longest session without duplicate activities: "abc")
# Critical for maintaining optimal user experience and system efficiency
```

## 2. Modern AI Application: Context Window Optimization and Token Management

### Problem Statement
An AI system needs to:
- Optimize context windows for language models without token repetition
- Maximize information density in AI prompts by eliminating redundant content
- Manage training data sequences to ensure diverse, non-repetitive learning samples
- Optimize inference efficiency through unique context window management

### Technical Innovation
The same algorithm that optimizes user sessions can enhance AI systems:
- Dynamic context window optimization for maximum unique token utilization
- Training data diversity optimization through non-repetitive sequence identification
- Inference efficiency improvement by managing unique context representations
- Automated prompt engineering through optimal unique content selection

### Example
```python
ai_context_tokens = "abcabcbb"  # AI context token sequence
optimal_context_length = optimize_context_window(tokens)
# Result: 3 (optimal unique context window for maximum information density)
# Essential for efficient AI inference and training data optimization
```

## 3. Algorithm Overview

### Core Problem
Find the length of the longest substring containing all unique characters:
- Use sliding window technique with character tracking
- Expand window while maintaining uniqueness constraint
- Contract window when duplicate character encountered
- Track maximum window size throughout the process

### Key Insights
- Sliding window maintains uniqueness invariant at all times
- Character position tracking enables efficient duplicate detection
- Window contraction jumps to optimal position after duplicate found
- Single pass solution with optimal time complexity

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the string
- **Space Complexity**: O(min(m,n)) where m is the character set size
