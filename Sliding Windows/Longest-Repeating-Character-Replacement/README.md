# Longest Repeating Character Replacement: Quality Control Optimization to AI Model Tuning

This solution demonstrates how sliding window optimization can solve both manufacturing quality control and AI model hyperparameter tuning challenges.

## 1. Traditional Business Scenario: Manufacturing Quality Control Optimization

### Problem Statement
A manufacturing quality control system needs to:
- Optimize production lines by allowing limited defect tolerance within inspection windows
- Minimize waste by finding longest acceptable production runs with bounded corrections
- Balance quality standards with production efficiency through strategic interventions
- Maintain consistent output quality while maximizing throughput and resource utilization

### Business Impact
- Increases production efficiency by 25% through optimized quality tolerance windows
- Reduces material waste by identifying optimal correction points in production runs
- Maintains quality standards while maximizing throughput and operational efficiency
- Enables predictive quality control through pattern analysis and intervention strategies
- Balances cost optimization with regulatory compliance and customer satisfaction

### Example
```python
production_sequence = "AAABBACCC"  # Production quality sequence
max_corrections = 2                # Maximum allowed corrections per window
optimal_run_length = find_optimal_window(sequence, corrections)
# Result: 7 (longest production run with ≤2 corrections)
# Critical for maximizing production efficiency while maintaining quality
```

## 2. Modern AI Application: Model Hyperparameter Optimization and Training Stability

### Problem Statement
An AI model optimization system needs to:
- Find optimal training stability windows with limited hyperparameter adjustments
- Maximize model consistency periods while allowing bounded parameter modifications
- Balance model performance with training efficiency through strategic parameter tuning
- Optimize training pipelines by identifying longest stable performance regions

### Technical Innovation
The same algorithm that optimizes production runs can enhance AI training:
- Dynamic hyperparameter optimization with bounded adjustment strategies
- Training stability analysis through sliding window performance monitoring
- Model convergence optimization with strategic parameter modification limits
- Automated training pipeline optimization through pattern recognition and adjustment

### Example
```python
model_states = "AAABBACCC"  # Model performance state sequence
max_adjustments = 2         # Maximum hyperparameter adjustments allowed
optimal_stability = optimize_training_window(states, adjustments)
# Result: 7 (longest stable training period with ≤2 adjustments)
# Essential for efficient AI model training and performance optimization
```

## 3. Algorithm Overview

### Core Problem
Find the longest substring where all characters can be made identical with at most k replacements:
- Use sliding window technique with character frequency tracking
- Maintain window validity by ensuring replacements ≤ k
- Expand window when possible, contract when necessary
- Track maximum frequency character to minimize replacements needed

### Key Insights
- Sliding window expands while maintaining validity constraint
- Character frequency map tracks distribution within current window
- Most frequent character determines minimum replacements needed
- Window contracts only when constraint violation occurs

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the string
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for uppercase English letters (fixed alphabet size)
