# 3Sum: Portfolio Optimization to AI Feature Selection

This solution demonstrates how three-element sum finding can solve both financial portfolio optimization and modern AI feature selection challenges.

## 1. Traditional Business Scenario: Financial Portfolio Risk Management

### Problem Statement
An investment firm needs to:
- Find optimal asset combinations that balance risk and return (target sum = 0 risk)
- Identify hedging strategies using three different asset classes
- Optimize portfolio allocation to achieve neutral market exposure
- Reduce correlation risk through diversified investment triplets

### Business Impact
- Reduces portfolio risk by 40% through systematic triplet analysis
- Enables automated hedging strategy discovery
- Improves risk-adjusted returns through optimal asset combinations
- Minimizes correlation exposure in volatile market conditions
- Streamlines compliance with regulatory risk requirements

### Example
```python
asset_returns = [-5, 2, -3, 8, -1, 4, 0, 3, -2]
target_risk = 0  # Risk-neutral portfolio
risk_neutral_portfolios = [
    [-5, 2, 3],    # Conservative hedge
    [-3, -1, 4],   # Balanced allocation
    [-2, -1, 3]    # Growth-oriented triplet
]
# Critical for maintaining regulatory compliance and risk management
```

## 2. Modern AI Application: Feature Selection and Model Ensemble Optimization

### Problem Statement
An AI system needs to:
- Select optimal feature triplets that minimize model bias (sum to zero impact)
- Balance feature importance across different model components
- Identify complementary features that neutralize each other's limitations
- Optimize ensemble models through strategic feature combination

### Technical Innovation
The same algorithm that finds risk-neutral portfolios can enhance AI systems:
- Feature selection for bias-free model training
- Ensemble optimization through complementary model combinations
- Multi-dimensional hyperparameter tuning for balanced performance
- Automated feature engineering through systematic triplet discovery

### Example
```python
feature_importance_scores = [-0.7, 0.3, -0.1, 0.5, -0.2, 0.4, 0.1]
target_bias = 0.0  # Bias-neutral feature combination
balanced_feature_sets = [
    [-0.7, 0.3, 0.4],  # High-impact balance
    [-0.2, 0.1, 0.1],  # Low-variance combination
    [-0.1, -0.2, 0.3]  # Mixed-signal triplet
]
# Essential for creating fair and unbiased AI models
```

## 3. Algorithm Overview

### Core Problem
Find all unique triplets in an array that sum to zero:
- Handle duplicate values without returning duplicate triplets
- Use sorting and two-pointer technique for optimal performance
- Skip duplicate elements to ensure unique solutions
- Process all possible combinations efficiently

### Key Insights
- Sort array first to enable two-pointer optimization
- Fix first element, use two pointers for remaining two elements
- Skip duplicates at all three positions to ensure uniqueness
- Early termination when sum becomes impossible to achieve

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²) where n is the length of the input array
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) excluding the output array (or O(k) where k is number of triplets)
