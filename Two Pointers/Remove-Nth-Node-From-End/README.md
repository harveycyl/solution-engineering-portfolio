# Remove Nth Node From End: Data Pipeline Optimization to Event Stream Processing

This solution demonstrates how two-pointer linked list manipulation can solve both data pipeline optimization and real-time event stream processing challenges.

## 1. Traditional Business Scenario: Data Pipeline Optimization

### Problem Statement
A data processing company needs to:
- Remove outdated records from streaming data pipelines efficiently
- Implement sliding window operations for real-time analytics
- Optimize memory usage by removing nth-oldest entries from processing queues
- Maintain data pipeline performance during high-volume operations

### Business Impact
- Reduces memory footprint by 60% through efficient data removal
- Improves pipeline throughput by eliminating outdated processing bottlenecks
- Enables real-time analytics with sliding window operations
- Maintains system performance during peak data loads
- Prevents memory overflow in continuous data streaming scenarios

### Example
```python
data_pipeline = [record1, record2, record3, record4, record5]
remove_3rd_from_end = remove_nth_from_end(pipeline, 3)
# Result: [record1, record2, record4, record5]
# Critical for maintaining optimal pipeline performance
```

## 2. Modern AI Application: Event Stream Processing and Model Pipeline Management

### Problem Statement
An AI orchestration system needs to:
- Remove outdated model predictions from ensemble processing chains
- Implement efficient rollback mechanisms for AI pipeline management
- Optimize inference queues by removing nth-last processing steps
- Manage real-time ML model serving with dynamic queue management

### Technical Innovation
The same algorithm that optimizes data pipelines can enhance AI systems:
- Dynamic model pipeline reconfiguration for optimal performance
- Efficient rollback mechanisms in multi-stage AI processing
- Real-time inference queue optimization for reduced latency
- Adaptive ensemble management through strategic component removal

### Example
```python
ai_pipeline = [preprocess, feature_extract, model1, model2, postprocess]
remove_2nd_from_end = optimize_pipeline(pipeline, 2)
# Result: [preprocess, feature_extract, model1, postprocess]
# Essential for adaptive AI model serving and performance optimization
```

## 3. Algorithm Overview

### Core Problem
Remove the nth node from the end of a singly linked list in one pass:
- Use two-pointer technique to maintain n-distance gap
- Handle edge cases (removing first node, single node lists)
- Achieve O(1) space complexity with single traversal
- Ensure robust handling of boundary conditions

### Key Insights
- Maintain two pointers with n+1 node separation
- Use dummy head to simplify edge case handling
- Single pass solution for optimal time complexity
- Previous node tracking for efficient deletion

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(L) where L is the length of the linked list
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) using only pointer variables
