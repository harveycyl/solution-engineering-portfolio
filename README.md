# Business-Driven Problem Solving

This repository contains a collection of classic programming challenges (from platforms like LeetCode) reframed as solutions to real-world business problems. Each folder represents a specific problem and includes:

1.  A business scenario that requires a technical solution.
2.  The corresponding programming solution and technical explanation.

The goal is to demonstrate not just how to code, but how to apply technical skills to solve practical business needs.
