# Solution Engineering Portfolio: From Algorithms to AI Orchestration

This repository transforms classic programming challenges into dual-purpose solutions that bridge traditional business problems and modern AI system design. Each implementation demonstrates how fundamental algorithms can solve both conventional business needs and contemporary AI orchestration challenges.

## Portfolio Philosophy

### Beyond Traditional Problem Solving
Instead of treating algorithms as abstract puzzles, this portfolio:
- Connects theoretical concepts to real-world applications
- Demonstrates practical business value
- Shows how classic solutions adapt to modern AI challenges

### Dual-Purpose Solutions
Each solution presents exactly:
1. **One Business Use Case**
   - Single practical business scenario
   - Clear value proposition
   - Industry-relevant application

2. **One AI Orchestration Use Case**
   - Single AI system orchestration scenario
   - Model coordination or workflow optimization
   - Measurable performance improvement

**Important**: Each problem includes only 1 business case + 1 AI case. No additional use cases should be added.
