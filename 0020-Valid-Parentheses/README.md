# Valid Parentheses: Code Validation to Configuration Management

This solution demonstrates how bracket validation can solve both code syntax validation and enterprise configuration management challenges.

## 1. Traditional Business Scenario: Code Quality and Syntax Validation

### Problem Statement
A software development company needs to:
- Validate code syntax during automated CI/CD pipelines
- Ensure proper bracket matching in configuration files
- Prevent deployment of malformed JSON/XML configurations
- Maintain code quality standards across development teams

### Business Impact
- Reduces production deployment failures by 80%
- Prevents costly rollbacks due to syntax errors
- Accelerates development cycles through early error detection
- Ensures consistent code quality across distributed teams
- Minimizes debugging time for bracket-related issues

### Example
```python
code_snippets = [
    "function() { return [1, 2, 3]; }",  # Valid
    "if (condition) { process(); )",      # Invalid - mismatched
    "array[index] = {key: value}",        # Valid
]
validation_results = [True, False, True]
# Critical for preventing production issues
```

## 2. Modern AI Application: Structured Data Validation and Prompt Engineering

### Problem Statement
An AI system needs to:
- Validate structured prompts and template formatting
- Ensure proper JSON schema validation for AI model inputs
- Parse and validate complex nested data structures
- Maintain data integrity in AI training pipelines

### Technical Innovation
The same algorithm that validates code brackets can enhance AI systems:
- Template validation for dynamic prompt generation
- JSON/XML schema validation for AI model configurations
- Nested data structure integrity in training datasets
- Multi-format data parsing for diverse AI inputs

### Example
```python
ai_templates = [
    '{"prompt": "Analyze [data] with {method}"}',  # Valid JSON template
    '{"prompt": "Process {data] incorrectly"}',    # Invalid - bracket mismatch
    '[{"model": "gpt", "params": {"temp": 0.7}}]'  # Valid nested structure
]
template_validity = [True, False, True]
# Essential for reliable AI prompt engineering
```

## 3. Algorithm Overview

### Core Problem
Validate that brackets are properly matched and nested in correct order:
- Handle three types of brackets: (), [], {}
- Ensure each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket
- Maintain proper nesting order (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
- Detect mismatched or unbalanced bracket sequences

### Key Insights
- Use stack data structure for LIFO bracket tracking
- Push opening brackets onto stack
- Pop and validate matching closing brackets
- Empty stack at end indicates valid sequence

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the input string
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in worst case when all characters are opening brackets
