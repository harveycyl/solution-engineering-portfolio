# Two Sum: From Business Logic to AI Orchestration

This solution demonstrates how a classic algorithmic problem can solve both traditional business needs and modern AI system challenges.

## 1. Traditional Business Scenario: Expense Report Reconciliation

### Problem Statement
An accounting department is verifying expense reports where:
- They have a summary charge of **$37**
- They need to find **two specific transactions** in a detailed list that sum to this total
- Quick verification is needed for efficiency

### Business Impact
- Reduces manual review time
- Prevents accounting errors
- Streamlines expense approval process
- Scales to handle large transaction volumes

### Example
```python
transactions = [5, 12, 25, 18, 10]
target = 37
result: Found $12 and $25 (at indices 1 and 2)
```

## 2. Modern AI Application: Model Capability Orchestration

### Problem Statement
An AI system needs to:
- Combine multiple specialized AI models to meet a capability threshold
- Find complementary models that sum to a required capability score
- Efficiently match model pairs for optimal performance

### Technical Innovation
The same algorithm that matches transactions can orchestrate AI models:
- Models have capability scores (e.g., 0.4, 0.7)
- Target threshold represents required capability (e.g., 1.0)
- Algorithm finds complementary model pairs

### Example
```python
models = [
    {"name": "text-analysis", "capability": 0.4},
    {"name": "classification", "capability": 0.7},
    {"name": "summarization", "capability": 0.6}
]
target = 1.0
result: Matched "text-analysis" (0.4) with "summarization" (0.6)
```

## 3. Technical Implementation

### Solution Approach
- Uses hash map (dictionary) for O(n) time complexity
- Single-pass algorithm for optimal performance
- Handles both integer and floating-point values
- Returns indices for easy lookup

### Key Features
- Unified solution for both business and AI scenarios
- Efficient memory usage
- Scalable to large datasets
- Clear, maintainable code structure

### Usage
Run `solution.py` to see both:
1. Traditional expense matching
2. AI model capability pairing

## 4. Extended Applications

### Business Domain
- Invoice matching
- Budget allocation
- Payment reconciliation
- Resource pairing

### AI/ML Domain
- Model ensemble creation
- Capability complementing
- Resource optimization
- Service orchestration

This implementation showcases how fundamental algorithms can bridge traditional business logic and modern AI system design, providing value in both contexts.
